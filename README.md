**Deployed Link:** [Environment Impact Analyzer](https://environment-impact-analyzer.streamlit.app/)

## Overview

Environment Impact Analyzer is a project aimed at providing a comprehensive platform for analyzing environmental data and facilitating informed decision-making. Leveraging advanced algorithms and intuitive visualizations, this tool empowers users to explore environmental trends, identify areas of concern, and propose sustainable strategies for development.

## Data Sources

Data from various APIs related to air quality, soil quality, climate, and water quality is utilized. These datasets are converted into JSON format and stored in MongoDB for easy access and analysis within the Environment Impact Analyzer.

- Air data: [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api/air-pollution) 🌬️
- Soil data: [GetAmbee API](https://www.getambee.com/api/soil) 🌱
- Climate data: [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/history) 🌦️
- Water quality: [Central Pollution Control Board](https://cpcb.nic.in/nwmp-data/) 💧

## Algorithms and Tools

The project utilizes various algorithms such as:

1. **Divide and Conquer**: Merge Sort and Binary Search ➗
2. **Greedy Approach**: Dijkstra Algorithm (to find shortest distance) 💡
3. **Dynamic Programming**: General method (to optimize efficient recommendations) 🔄

For development, the following tools and frameworks are used:

- **Streamlit**: For building the user interface 🚀
- **Python**: Backend development 🐍
- **Gemini LLM by Google**: For accessing additional environmental data 🌟

The data is stored and managed using MongoDB 📊.

## Features
